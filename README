Beginning TDD

The goal of this exercise is to get you to practice the process of TDD: Test, Code, Refactor.

Towards this end, (re)build the fmtRewrap functionality with TDD. Start with the given API (namely, a static method). As your tests proceed, you may decide that an object-orientation is more appropriate. It is not required that you make this transition; I'm more interested in where the tests lead you.

You should turn in a story, with tests and snippets of code as illustrations. (Koskela Chapter 2 is a great model for this.) Each snippet of code should do only as much as is needed by the tests considered so far. Your story should start with a single "happy path" test case, and should take you through a handful of further test cases.

Grading: 
This is really a "completion" type of assignment. Write each test, build only the code that passes the test, and document the progress. Refactor as necessary, and document that.
